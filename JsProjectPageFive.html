				<h3 class="questionTitles"><a name="question1">Answer One</a></h3>
				<li class="moreItems">Simply put, yes it does. Unfortunately, IMDb doesn't go further to explain this answer.</li><br>
				<h3 class="questionTitles"></h3>
				<li class="moreItems"><a name="question2">Katniss volunteers to take the place of her little sister. She is coached along with Peeta Melark by Haymitch Abernathy. Katniss and Peeta are sent away to survive against 22 other opponents.</a></li><br>

				<h3 class="questionTitles"></h3>
				<li class="moreItems"><a name="question4">Before it became a corupt gameshow, the Hunger Games were created after the original 13 districts rose against the Capitol. The districts were defeated and District 13 was bombed until it was gone. In penance for the uprising, each of the 12 discricts must offer up two tributes, one male and female, for a battle to the death. However, this has now just for putting on a good show and intimidating the population.</a></li><br>
				<h3 class="questionTitles"></h3>
				<li class="moreItems"><a name="question5">We don't know many of them. Most of them had died in the first battle around the cornicopia. Besides Katniss and Peeta, we do know Glimmer, Marvel, Rue, Clove, Foxface, Thresh, and Cato. </a></li><br>
				<h3 class="questionTitles"></h3>
				<li class="moreItems"><a name="question6">Between the Reaping and the start of the games is just one week. Day 1 is the journey to the capitol. Day is makeovers and the tribute parade. Day 3 and 4 are for training. Day 5 is skill demonstration with day 6 reserved for interviews with Caesar Flickerman. Day 7 is when the games begin.</a></li><br>
				<h3 class="questionTitles"></h3>
				<li class="moreItems"><a name="question7">The country of Panem is located in what used to be The United States of America. This country was created after natural disasters ruined the country. The capitol is located in the Rocky Mountains. The districts surround the capitol, districts 1 and 2 are the closest and district 12 is the farthest. This district is located in the Appalachian Mountains due to the district being dedicated to coal mining.</a></li><br>
				<h3 class="questionTitles"></h3>
				<li class="moreItems"><a name="question8">Becoming a career, if you're from the career districts, is the fastest but most dangerous way to become rich. Every district has some level of poverty but the career districts are the most wealthy. If someone wins, they get to live in a nice house in Victor's Village. They also get a lot of money, medical treatment after the games, and the winners family gets extra food for a year. So if a career trains for their entire life, they have a high chance at winning.</a></li><br>
				<h3 class="questionTitles"></h3>
				<li class="moreItems"><a name="question9">According to the book, Katniss states "It is an old and rarely used gesture of our discrict, occasionally seen at funerals. It means thanks, it means admiration, it means good-bye to someone you love."</a></li><br>
				<h3 class="questionTitles"></h3>
				<li class="moreItems"><a name="question10">In simple terms, the book described Rue and Thresh this way. In the novel, they are described as having "dark down skin and eyes." This could be confusing for some because Katniss claims Rue is much like her sister Prim. The reason they are similar is because they share many personality traits. It not about Rue and Prim's looks.</a></li><br>
				<h3 class="questionTitles"></h3>
				<li class="moreItems"><a name="question11">After the death of Cato, it is just Katniss and Peeta. The Gamemakers change to rule back to there can only be one winner. Peeta offers himself up to be killed but Katniss refuses to do that. She gives him some of the nightlock berries and suggests that there shouldn't be any winners. The Gamemakers panic and stop them, declaring them both winners. After coming back the Capitol, Haymitch warns them that they've made some powerful enemies. As they are crowned winners by President Snow, Seneca Crane is locked in a room with a bowl of nightlock berries. He must eat them as punishment for letting this happen.</a></li><br>
				<h3 class="questionTitles"></h3>
				<li class="moreItems"><a name="question12">Katniss and Peeta are crowned winners. Glimmer is stung to death by trackerjackers. Marvel is killed after Katniss shoots him with an arrow. Rue was stabbed by Marvel's spear. Clove was beat to death by Thresh. Foxface eats nightlock berries accidently picked by Peeta. Thresh was killed by mutant dogs. Cato made it to final three but fell off the cornicopia and attacked by the mutant killer dogs. Seneca Crane was forced to eat nightlock berries. His fate is much like the Roman philosopher Seneca the Younger, who was condemned to suicide by blood loss.</a></li><br>
				<h3 class="questionTitles"></h3>
				<li class="moreItems"><a name="question13">The 12-rated UK cut has less blood and is more censored. The Blu-ray version has come with an uncensored version with a 15 rating.</a></li>

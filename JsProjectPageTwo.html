				<h3>About The Movie</h3>
				<p id="summary">In a divided up North America, there are 12 districts and one capitol. Each year the 12 districts offer up one male and one female to fight in a battle to the death. Only one can win. The story begins in a small district in what was the New York area. District 12 was for coal mining and was a very poor district. During the annual reaping, Primrose Everdeen is picked. Her sister, wanting to protect her from certain death, decides to volunteer as tribute. Peeta Melark is also picked. As a way to gain sympathy and sponsorships, their coach, Haymitch and Peeta make up a story of how Peeta has feelings for a girl back home but she had came with him - that girl being Katniss. Soon, during training, it's clear none of the gamemakers see her potential until she nearly shoots them. This results in them giving her the highest training score of 11 out of all of the participants. During the games, Peeta turns on her and helps pople hunt her down but they end up betraying him and leave him to die of sickness. Katniss finds his blood trail and finds him camoflagued. She helps take care of him and soon their love begins to blossom. Then, the gamemakers make a rule that if two people from the same district are alive still, they both win. This results in a final showdown with Katniss, Peeta, and District 2's Cato. Cato is eliminated by rabid wolves*?* then the it leaves Peeta and Katniss. The gamemakers tell them the two winner rule was a lie and they must battle it out. They decide to eat poisonous berries together so there is no winner. The winners of the 74 annual Hunger Games is Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Melark. This event leads the beginning of a domino effect.</p></p>

				<h3>Why Do I Like This Movie?</h3>
				<p>I like this movie because I loved the story. I had read the book and I loved how there was enough conflict for me to keep reading. There was suspense, love, anger, and a whole bunch more. I liked the setting and the way the districts were portrayed.</p>
